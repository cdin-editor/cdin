<p align="center">The composition root for the CDIN editor components.</p>

CDIN brings together the Kernel, Runtime, Backend and Frontend projects. It owns the application build, dependency pins, packaging, launcher and process lifecycle. Editor behavior lives in the component that owns it.

## What is CDIN?

A user-facing editor needs a document engine, editor policy, operating-system services and a way to present the interface. CDIN keeps those responsibilities in separate projects and connects them through their public contracts.

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| **Kernel** | Owns document bytes, edits, versions, snapshots and undo/redo. |
| **Runtime** | Runs Lua 5.4 editor policy: commands, keymaps, configuration and plugins. |
| **Backend** | Hosts Kernel and Runtime, manages sessions and OS services, and serves the Frontend Protocol. |
| **Frontend** | Adapts input, presents the semantic UI model, performs visual layout and renders the editor. |
| **CDIN** | Pins, builds, packages and launches the components. |

CDIN is not a second editor engine. It must not copy document operations from Kernel, keymap or plugin behavior from Runtime, session logic from Backend, or layout and rendering from Frontend.

## Current status

The Composition Root candidate is tracked by [PR #110](https://github.com/cdin-editor/cdin/pull/110), branch `feature/complete-composition-root-rewrite`. Current head: `8d4aaf425cd544ae085ccfe256ce964a55793d9a`. It now pins Frontend PR #18's immutable candidate `bb22901e82f4b0f3a6aa0eefdd22265465564cd3`. The latest CDIN full-stack run [42309344504](https://github.com/cdin-editor/cdin/actions/runs/42309344504) is queued after the pin update; its result is not yet verified.

The previous full-stack run [42306512218](https://github.com/cdin-editor/cdin/actions/runs/42306512218) isolated the Windows failure to `cdin_tui_live_conpty_smoke`: the ConPTY child receives pipe-backed standard handles, so `GetConsoleMode` on `GetStdHandle` returned `ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE (6)`. The GUI-SDL live Backend/Runtime session smoke passed on Windows in that run. The new Frontend candidate opens `CONIN# CDIN

## Current status

 for ConPTY/redirected stdio, restores their modes and closes only handles owned by the TUI adapter; the refreshed CDIN run must verify that path.

Frontend PR #17 was merged into `main` at [`fea9560`](https://github.com/cdin-editor/frontend/commit/fea9560d60085aa4d579efc6a584d90349ee4ac0). Follow-up PR [#18](https://github.com/cdin-editor/frontend/pull/18) carries the review fixes: strict snapshot revision monotonicity, exact visible-line request correlation, no Runtime-owned selection cache, required pixel units for GUI-SDL, filtering input by SDL window ID, and the Windows ConPTY handle fallback. Its latest CI [42309328264](https://github.com/cdin-editor/frontend/actions/runs/42309328264) has passed Linux/macOS native jobs and Pipeline quality; Windows and the SDL3 AddressSanitizer/package-consumer job are running after the pixel-unit validation test was corrected. This is candidate verification, not a merge or release-readiness claim.

Backend PR #18 is ready for review at 987acd2f04bf6cc7eed360a4328bb11085628457. [Backend CI 42300963625](https://github.com/cdin-editor/backend/actions/runs/42300963625) passed Markdown lint, Pipeline quality and Lua 5.4 resolver integration on Ubuntu, macOS and Windows. [Live Runtime integration 42300963086](https://github.com/cdin-editor/backend/actions/runs/42300963086), [Native resource stress 42300963234](https://github.com/cdin-editor/backend/actions/runs/42300963234) and [Code Quality 42300958559](https://github.com/cdin-editor/backend/actions/runs/42300958559) also passed. Backend Issue [#14](https://github.com/cdin-editor/backend/issues/14) is closed with these results.

The headless editing/save path and POSIX PTY remain verified on earlier fully green CDIN candidate [42265415995](https://github.com/cdin-editor/cdin/actions/runs/42265415995), before GUI-SDL composition was added. That historical evidence is not a substitute for current-head GUI acceptance. Keep interactive GUI-SDL launch experimental behind CDIN_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_GUI_SDL=1; the renderer is still an ASCII/debug-text baseline, with font shaping, bidi/Persian layout, IME and full pane rendering incomplete.

The CDIN epic [#111](https://github.com/cdin-editor/cdin/issues/111) remains open. Reconnect with pending work, process recovery, repeated start/stop, plugin capability isolation, product RSS/latency/soak baselines and native installers remain release gates. CodeQL C/C++, Python and Actions checks pass, but the JavaScript/TypeScript job fails because this repository has no JS/TS source; remove that language from the repository security/code-scanning language selection. This is a repository setting, not a source change.

The [CDIN Specification](https://github.com/cdin-editor/spec) defines the cross-component contracts. This README describes the implementation in this repository and does not override the Spec.

## Build the pinned stack

You need a C11 compiler, CMake 3.22 or newer, Make, Git, Python 3.11 or newer, `pkg-config`, PUC Lua 5.4 development files and Go 1.25 or newer for the repository tools.

Clone CDIN and build the pinned component stack:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cdin-editor/cdin.git
cd cdin
make stack
```

The stack task checks out the immutable revisions in `deps.lock`, builds and tests the pinned logger, Kernel, Backend and Frontend projects, installs them into `.deps/install`, then builds CDIN and runs its CLI and lifecycle checks.

Platform-specific setup and the full local workflow are in the [Developer guide](docs/development.md). For a short explanation of the commands available today, see the [User guide](docs/user-guide.md).

## Try the current executable

After `make stack`, the executable is installed under `.deps/install/bin`:

```sh
./.deps/install/bin/cdin --help
./.deps/install/bin/cdin --version
./.deps/install/bin/cdin --check
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy ./.deps/install/bin/cdin --frontend gui-sdl --check
# Interactive GUI is experimental:
CDIN_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_GUI_SDL=1 ./.deps/install/bin/cdin --frontend gui-sdl
```

On Windows, use `.deps/install/bin/cdin.exe` from the MSYS2 UCRT64 environment.

The `--check` command is a headless lifecycle and protocol integration check. It attaches a Frontend Protocol session, verifies snapshot/flush/ACK and resize, then exercises document create → text/paste → undo/redo → save → close → open through public Frontend/Backend/Runtime/Kernel APIs. It compares exact bytes, including NUL, invalid UTF-8, BOM and line-ending variants, against both disk and the reopened document. The headless CTest passed in the Linux, macOS and Windows jobs in CI run 42117574266. It does not render a display or launch the TUI. On POSIX, an experimental TUI path can be attempted only with `CDIN_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_TUI=1`; its release gate is still failing.

## What CDIN provides

- Immutable component and tooling pins in `deps.lock`.
- A repeatable source-build workflow for the pinned component stack.
- Build-time Frontend/Backend Protocol version checks and runtime Backend/Runtime version checks.
- Runtime asset installation and Backend lifecycle composition.
- A small CLI for help, version and lifecycle validation.
- Pipeline tasks, PSX repository checks and Gix branch-flow configuration.
- A deterministic source snapshot with SHA-256 verification; trusted pushes to `main` receive artifact provenance attestation after all required CI jobs pass.
